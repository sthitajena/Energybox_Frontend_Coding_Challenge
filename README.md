#Coding Challenge - Frontend Developer


#Now more about the assignment:

I like Trains, and now you do too!

Let's use the WMATA open API to visualize some live train data. Don't feel obligated to spend any more than 2-5 hours on this. You're welcome to spend more time if you're having fun, but you won't be judged on how much you complete.

Getting Started

You'll have to sign up for an account: https://developer.wmata.com/signup/

And subscribe to the basic developer subscription: https://developer.wmata.com/Products -> default tier -> add subscription ( it's free, don't worry.)

The API can be found at: https://developer.wmata.com/docs/services/ -> Train Positions

There's also a demo key available at: https://developer.wmata.com/Products . e13626d03d8e4c03ac07f95541b3091b

API to use: Train Positions API

Assignment

Tech to use:

React and Javascript!

Don't know any React? Head to the react docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html

Feel free to use CRA as a base for starting this project ( https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app )

DO NOT USE ANY NON-DEVELOPMENT DEPENDENCIES OTHER THAN THOSE INCLUDED IN CRA ( IE. NO using libraries/modules such as Lodash, Axios, Ramda, Material UI, Bootstrap etc. )

Try to complete the user stories below as best you can, and feel free to add in any features you'd like to see that may not be detailed here. The stories are purposefully vague and open to interpretation. 

User Stories:

As a user I'd like to be able to see all the trains!

As a user I'd like to be able to filter by train line color.

As a user I'd like to be able to filter by different service types.

As a user I'd like to be able to filter by car count.

As a user I'd like to be able to visually distinguish trains on different colored lines from each other.

As a user I'd like to be able to visually distinguish between different car counts. 

As a user I'd like to be able to distinguish trains by different service types.

As a user I'd like to see the page automatically update as the trains' positions update.

Good luck!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
